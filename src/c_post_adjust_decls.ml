    separates declarations from initialization in some cases, e.g.

    {
    if (foo(x, y) < 0) goto catch;
    int a = 5;
    ...
  catch:
    ...
    }

    =>

    {
    int a;
    if (foo(x, y) < 0) goto catch;
    a = 5;
    ...
  catch:
    ...
    }

    this is necessary to shutup C++ compiler that reports error in such case,
    even though C compiler processes the same code just fine.
    the extra trick is applied not to retain the array initializations as-is (we
    take care in c_gen_code.ml that such array initializations are enclosed into dedicated
    code blocks without jumps in the middle) and to retain declarations+initializations
    in the beginning of each code block.
